<p class="centered montserrat bold white">Hi, I'm Luke Chen Shui and I made this site. 
    Normally, I have trouble practicing coding consistently. Usually, I get struck by an idea 
    and passionately work on it for a few weeks and then go into hibernation. This has worked
    for me well enough, but I believe that I do need to get into the habit of consistently 
    practicing coding more consistently. That's why I made this site.</p>
